Machine Learning-ML is the filed of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
Types-
1. Supervised Learning-Supervised learning is an approach to creating artificial intelligence (AI) where a computer algorithm is trained on input data that has been labeled for a particular output
2. Unsupervised Learning-Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that allows a model to learn from a dataset without any pre-existing labels or categories. In other words, the model is given a set of unlabeled data and is left to discover patterns, relationships, and insights on its own.
3. Reinforcement Learning-Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The goal is to maximize the cumulative reward over time, which is achieved by learning the optimal policy that maps states to actions.
4. Semi supervised Learning-Semi-supervised learning is a type of machine learning that falls between supervised and unsupervised learning. It is a method that uses a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to train a model. The goal of semi-supervised learning is to learn a function that can accurately predict the output variable based on the input variables, similar to supervised learning.

Types of Supervised Learning-
1.Regression: Predicting a continuous output value, such as predicting the price of a house based on its features.
2.Classification: Predicting a categorical output, such as spam vs. non-spam emails.
3.Binary Classification: Predicting a binary output, such as 0 or 1, yes or no, etc.
4.Multi-Class Classification: Predicting a categorical output with more than two classes, such as predicting the type of fruit (apple, banana, orange, etc.).
5.Structured Output Regression: Predicting a structured output, such as a sequence of words or a time series.

Types of Unsupervised learning-
1.Clustering: Grouping similar data points into clusters based on their features.
2.Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of features in a dataset while preserving the most important information.
3.Anomaly Detection: Identifying data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data.
4.Association Rule Learning: Discovering relationships between variables in a dataset.
5.Density-Based Clustering: Grouping data points based on their density in the feature space.
